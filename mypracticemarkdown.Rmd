```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown


```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp, col = as.factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```
